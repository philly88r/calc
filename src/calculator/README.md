# Fence Calculator Refactoring Guide

## Overview

This directory contains extracted calculation functions from the main FenceCalculator component. The goal is to make the codebase more manageable without changing how the calculator works or looks.

## How to Use This Structure

### Current Structure

- **FenceCalculator.js**: The original, complete component (4000+ lines)
- **calculator/**: Directory containing extracted calculation functions
  - **postCalculations.js**: Post-related calculation functions
  - **gateCalculations.js**: Gate-related calculation functions
  - **materialCalculations.js**: Material cost calculation functions
  - **utilityFunctions.js**: General utility functions
  - **index.js**: Exports all functions from a single import point

### Making Edits to the Calculator

When you need to make changes to the calculator:

1. **For calculation logic changes**:
   - Find the appropriate function in the calculator directory
   - Make your changes there
   - The main component will use the updated function

2. **For UI changes**:
   - Continue editing the main FenceCalculator.js file
   - The UI structure remains unchanged

3. **For adding new calculations**:
   - Add the function to the appropriate file in the calculator directory
   - Export it from the index.js file
   - Import and use it in FenceCalculator.js

## Gradual Migration Strategy

To fully migrate the FenceCalculator component to use the extracted functions:

1. Start by replacing one calculation function at a time in the main component
2. Test thoroughly after each replacement
3. Continue until all calculation logic is using the extracted functions

This approach allows you to maintain the exact functionality and appearance while making the codebase more manageable.

## Benefits

- **Smaller main component**: Makes the FenceCalculator.js file easier to navigate
- **Better organization**: Related functions are grouped together
- **Easier testing**: Calculation functions can be tested independently
- **Improved maintainability**: Changes to calculation logic don't require editing the main component
