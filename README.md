# Fence Calculator and Product Catalog

This project includes a fence calculator and a product catalog that integrates with the Lightspeed Retail API.

## Product Catalog Features

The product catalog provides comprehensive display of product information including:
- Name
- Description
- SKU
- Images
- Price
- Category

All products are fetched from the Lightspeed API without limits, allowing for a complete catalog view.

## API Integration

The application uses a proxy server to communicate with the Lightspeed API, avoiding CORS issues and protecting API credentials.

### Environment Setup

Before running the application, you need to set up your environment variables:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Lightspeed API key and database connection string to the `.env` file

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the Application

To run the complete application, you need to start both the React frontend and the Node.js server:

1. Start the Node.js server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
   This will start the server on http://localhost:3001

2. In a separate terminal, start the React application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the React app on http://localhost:3000

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
